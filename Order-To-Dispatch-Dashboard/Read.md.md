## Tech Stack:



* Power BI: For interactive data visualization and dashboard development
* Oracle SQL: For backend querying from production tables (ORDER\_TO\_DISPATCH\_V, FM\_ORDER\_RECON\_SUMMARY, etc.)
* DAX: For custom calculations, measures, and business KPIs
* Toad for Oracle: For advanced SQL development, view creation, and testing



The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the order lifecycle from placement to final dispatch, integrating production, sizing, weaving, inspection, and shipment stages. It combines data from multiple Oracle tables and views, primarily ORDER\_TO\_DISPATCH\_V and FM\_ORDER\_RECON\_SUMMARY, to deliver actionable insights on:



Order progress by stage



Delays and early completions (e.g., sizing, weaving)



Shipping timelines and regional breakdowns



Order status summary (from reconciliation data)



KPIs like balance to ship, on-time performance, and production efficiency



This dashboard supports production planning, dispatch tracking, and business performance monitoring in a single, unified view.
